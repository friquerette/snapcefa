The purpose of this second is to discover:\
   . the observable with reactive programming,\
   . the use of form,\
   . communicate with the backend with the HTTP query,\
   . discovered the architecture with the use of module, the lazy loading and the guards.\
\
Part 1: The observable\
There are several technicals to handle asynchrone in javascript:\
   . callbacks : function call when a event appear\
   . promise with then() and catch()\
   . function async/await, function which wait until the event appear\
Angular provide a tool more powerful to handle it with the tools RxJS with its Observables\

lesson 1\
   a) use of interval() (an observable import from rxjs) and subscribe with the method subscribe()\
   b) declare the interval$ as observable which emit number and display the result into the template
      use the pipe Async which subscribe to the obsersable and dont format the data.
      Avoid to use the method subscribe() which is prohibated\
\
lesson 2\
   a) manipulate the emit value with operator of low level:\
      . pipe() allow to apply the operation on the at an Oberservable,\
      . map() is use to transforme the value,\
      . filter() to filter the emit value,\
      . tap() a side effect to send a value outside without modifying this value.\
\
lesson 3\
   operator of high level on the emit value, allow to subscribe to other Obersvable\
      . mergeMap() for paralleling stream\
      . concatMap() do one stream at once without ending if interrupt before the end\
      . exhaustMap() do a full stream before starting the next one, and ignore the ask when processing\
      . switch() do the last stream asked and interrupted it if there is a new ask\
\
lesson 4\
   Handle memory leak (fuite de m√©moire)\
   subscribe() each time that a obervable is subscribe its life continue when the composant is unload, and a second is load when the component is load a second time\
   take(x) complete when the number of emit is reach, here x\
